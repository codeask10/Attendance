The Attendance Management System is a web application designed to track and manage attendance records for students and teachers. The system allows users to log in securely, view their attendance history, and administrators to manage user data efficiently. The application was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and provides RESTful APIs for backend communication.
